# XGB 
This repsoitory contains the basic code of machine learning learning package XGBoost applied to lambda reconstruction at the CBM experiment at GSI/FAIR.
The code is split into different files so that it is more readible. To use the main file "CBM_ML_XGB_package.py" the rest of the files need to be downloaded and saved in a single directory on a personal computer.
